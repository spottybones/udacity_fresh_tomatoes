# Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer Website

This is the project output for the Udacity "Programming Foundations with Python"
course. When run the code generates an HTML file and opens it in a browser
window. The opened page displays the original poster, title, and MPAA rating of
several of my favorite movies. Clicking on the movie poster will open and play
the movie's trailer in an embedded IFRAME.

## Requirements

This code requires Python 2.7. The page generated can be displayed in
any HTML5 compliant web browser.
